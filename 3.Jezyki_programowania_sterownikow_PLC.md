## 3.3 LD (LAD)

### General:
The Ladder Diagram, also known as LAD or LD is a graphics-oriented programming language, used to create software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in industrial control applications. It’s used for documentation and implementation of software in manufacturing and process control. Its structure resembles that of an electric circuit. Its name derives from the graphic representation of the program resembling ladders. LD is standardized in IEC 611131-3.

LD was originally created to allow engineers to develop software without additional training in a programming language, hence its relative simplicity of development and structure. It is also why LD resembles in its presentation an electric circuit.

### Structure:
LD allows the construction of simple logical switches and more complex networks, when the programs call for sequential control over a process. Its structure consists of a series of networks, represented by horizontal lines, which run between two vertical lines – power rails, which run on the left and right side of the screen. A network can consist of contacts and connecting lines. One rung of the ladder allows the use of 29 contacts.

Ladder Logic is a rule-based language rather than a procedural one, which means that select rules are executed when activated if select conditions are met. Because of this, during execution of a program the rules are typically executed sequentially in a loop. Proper use of PLCs requires understanding of the logic behind the order of execution of particular rules (“rungs” on the ladder), along with the limitations that come with such an execution, such as hazards. The PLC executes the program one ‘ladder rung’ at a time.

### Components:

The main components in the language are connections between checkers and actuators.

*Some of the commonly used components in LAD*

The actuators (coils) represent the output signal. If a path can be traced from the left power rail to a select actuator, then the “rung” of the ladder is true (and by analogy, the coil is energized) and the actuator provides output 1. If no path can be traced (and the coil is deenergized), the output is 0. 

Coils can be:
* normally open
* normally closed
* type set
* type reset
* detecting a rising slope
* detecting a falling slope
* a continuation coil
* with a memory 

The checkers (contacts) also represent bits in the circuit. They make and break circuits that connect the power rails to the coils. A normally open checker will only close the circuit when its corresponding coil is energized.

Checkers can be:
* normally open
* normally closed
* a continuation checker

System variables can be used with coils and contacts to create things like generators, or variables which change after starting the program.

Additionally, LAD allows the use of function blocks. Such a block executes a specified function. It will receive input signals from the left and provide an output to its right. The output can be used later to control other components. Those function blocks can be, for example:
* adders
* counters
* multipliers
* timed relays

### Variables:
LD allows the use of following, basic types of variables:
* BOOL - a binary value
* INT - an integer number, usually takes up 8, 16 or 32 bits
* REAL - a real number, usually takes up 32 bits
* STRING - a sequence of characters

Particular hardware will use those types of variables, however there might be slight differences in, for example, their names e. g. a boolean value may be named as a binary value.

## 3.4 IL - instruction list

### General:
IL language is very rarely used nowadays. It is an effect of high complexity and need for handling low-level events similar to assembly language. Because of these disadvantages IL is very hard to learn and understand for people with no experience in programming or computer/CPUs architecture. Many PLC programmers bypass this language in favor of LD (3.3) and ST(3.5).
IL code is also very hard to read, so it is also very hard to debug and maintain. In IL programmer is able to conduct complex mathematical operations with usage of low computing power but it takes a lot of knowledge and time to write suitable code for it.
Instruction list language is very powerful because of writting operations directly on memory and has the best performance among all PLC programming languages described in this repository.

### Syntax and Structure:

IL programs consist of a sequence of instructions, each represented by a line of code. Each instruction performs a specific operation or control task. The syntax of IL is usually very concise and resembles assembly language in many ways. Here are some key aspects of IL syntax:

1. Operations and functions: IL uses mnemonic codes to represent operations or functions. For example, LD (Load), OUT (Output), AND (Logical AND), etc. These mnemonics make the code easier to read and understand (for beginners it is still very hard to understand because of its assembly-like structure).
2. Operands: Instructions in IL often have operands that specify data addresses, constants, or conditions. These operands are typically represented using symbolic names or addresses, making it easier to reference specific memory locations or input/output points.
3. Comments: IL allows for the inclusion of comments in the code, which helps programmers document their logic and make the code more readable and maintainable. Comment is everything after apostrophe character


### Key Features and Concepts:

1. Bit-Level Control: IL allows for precise control at the bit level, making it suitable for applications that require managing individual sensors, actuators, and other discrete devices.

2. Branching and Control Flow: The language supports branching and decision-making with instructions like JMP (Jump) and JZ (Jump if Zero). These are used to create conditional logic.

3. Timers and Counters: IL includes instructions for working with timers (TON, TOF, TP) and counters (CTU, CTD), essential for tasks that involve time-based control and counting operations.

4. Mathematical Operations: Complex mathematical operations are possible in IL, allowing for advanced calculations and control algorithms. Those are not easy to write or read but those are very fast because of its low-level syntax.

5. Input and Output Handling: IL provides instructions for reading input states and controlling output states (as every language designed for programming PLC).


### Advantages of IL:

* Performance: It provides direct control at the bit level, making it efficient for tasks requiring precise timing and control.

* Portability: IL code can often be easily transferred between different PLC brands and models, as it adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard.

* Flexibility: It can handle a wide range of control tasks, from basic logic operations to complex mathematical calculations.

### Disadvantages of IL:

* Complexity: IL language is not beginner-friendly to learn. Programmer have to understand the idea of registers, memory, etc. Instruction list is not intuitive at all.

* Time consuming: Writting simple program takes a lot of time because programmer have to handle/manage basic memory and processor operations in not effective way.

### Example for blinking diode:

    LD O0.1     'Load the current state of output O0.1
    NOT         'Invert the state (toggle)
    ST O0.1     'Store the toggled state back to output O0.1
    TON 1000    'Timer on-delay for 1000 milliseconds (1 s)
