## 3.4 IL - instruction list

### General:
IL language is very rarely used nowadays. It is an effect of high complexity and need for handling low-level events similar to assembly language. Because of these disadvantages IL is very hard to learn and understand for people with no experience in programming or computer/CPUs architecture. Many PLC programmers bypass this language in favor of LD (3.3) and ST(3.5).
IL code is also very hard to read, so it is also very hard to debug and maintain. In IL programmer is able to conduct complex mathematical operations with usage of low computing power but it takes a lot of knowledge and time to write suitable code for it.
Instruction list language is very powerful because of writting operations directly on memory and has the best performance among all PLC programming languages described in this repository.

### Syntax and Structure:

IL programs consist of a sequence of instructions, each represented by a line of code. Each instruction performs a specific operation or control task. The syntax of IL is usually very concise and resembles assembly language in many ways. Here are some key aspects of IL syntax:

1. Operations and functions: IL uses mnemonic codes to represent operations or functions. For example, LD (Load), OUT (Output), AND (Logical AND), etc. These mnemonics make the code easier to read and understand (for beginners it is still very hard to understand because of its assembly-like structure).
2. Operands: Instructions in IL often have operands that specify data addresses, constants, or conditions. These operands are typically represented using symbolic names or addresses, making it easier to reference specific memory locations or input/output points.
3. Comments: IL allows for the inclusion of comments in the code, which helps programmers document their logic and make the code more readable and maintainable. Comment is everything after apostrophe character


### Key Features and Concepts:

1. Bit-Level Control: IL allows for precise control at the bit level, making it suitable for applications that require managing individual sensors, actuators, and other discrete devices.

2. Branching and Control Flow: The language supports branching and decision-making with instructions like JMP (Jump) and JZ (Jump if Zero). These are used to create conditional logic.

3. Timers and Counters: IL includes instructions for working with timers (TON, TOF, TP) and counters (CTU, CTD), essential for tasks that involve time-based control and counting operations.

4. Mathematical Operations: Complex mathematical operations are possible in IL, allowing for advanced calculations and control algorithms. Those are not easy to write or read but those are very fast because of its low-level syntax.

5. Input and Output Handling: IL provides instructions for reading input states and controlling output states (as every language designed for programming PLC).


### Advantages of IL:

* Performance: It provides direct control at the bit level, making it efficient for tasks requiring precise timing and control.

* Portability: IL code can often be easily transferred between different PLC brands and models, as it adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard.

* Flexibility: It can handle a wide range of control tasks, from basic logic operations to complex mathematical calculations.

### Disadvantages of IL:

* Complexity: IL language is not beginner-friendly to learn. Programmer have to understand the idea of registers, memory, etc. Instruction list is not intuitive at all.

* Time consuming: Writting simple program takes a lot of time because programmer have to handle/manage basic memory and processor operations in not effective way.

### Example for blinking diode:

    LD O0.1     'Load the current state of output O0.1
    NOT         'Invert the state (toggle)
    ST O0.1     'Store the toggled state back to output O0.1
    TON 1000    'Timer on-delay for 1000 milliseconds (1 s)
